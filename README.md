A simple JavaScript utility for composing higher-order components.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i --save higher-order
```

## Usage
#### Simple
Here's a simple example to get you started.
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import higherOrder from 'higher-order';
import SomeHigherOrderComponent from './path/to/some-higher-order-component';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}

export default higherOrder(MyComponent)(SomeHigherOrderComponent);
```

#### Ordering higher-order components
There are times where the order in which you compose your higher-over components matters.  Higher Order composes your higher-order components in the reversed order that they are provided.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import higherOrder from 'higher-order';
import {
  FirstHigherOrder,
  SecondHigherOrder,
  ThirdHigherOrder
} from './path/to/higher-order-components';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}

export default higherOrder(MyComponent)(
  FirstHigherOrder,
  SecondHigherOrder,
  ThirdHigherOrder
);
```
This export translates to:

```js
export default FirstHigherOrder(
  SecondHigherOrder(
    ThirdHigherOrderComponent(MyComponent)
  )
);
```

#### Redux
Higher Order and Redux play nicely together too.
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import higherOrder from 'higher-order';
import SomeHigherOrderComponent from './path/to/some-higher-order-component';
import { mapStateToProps } from 'path/to/helpers';

class MyApp extends Component {
  // ...
}

export default higherOrder(MyApp)(
  connect(mapStateToProps),
  SomeHigherOrderComponent
);
```

## Why
If you've ever composed multiple Higher-order components then you've probably found yourself deeply nesting â€” I like to call this *The Higher Order Pyramid of Doom*.

```js
export default FirstHigherOrder(
  SecondHigherOrder(
    ThirdHigherOrderComponent(MyComponent)
  )
);
```

Higher Order solves this by providing more readable interface for higher-order component compositions.
